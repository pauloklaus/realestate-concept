# realestate-concept

Concept project with an example of a VueJS use case, with the following resources:

* vuex
* vue-rotuer
* bootstrap
* firebase realtime database
* firebase storage
* componente externo (github.com/pauloklaus/psk-copyandshare)

The objective is to display some properties of owners previously available in firebase, with photos stored in storage. 

You can also bookmark properties and share a link with anyone :-)

Hope you like it.
